Installation instructions

Creating folders
Before you can start working (developing/testing) with the game, you have to
create these empty folders:

/images/maps
/temp
/temp/cache
/temp/sessions
/app/log

. They are used to store generated data and they have to exist else you won't 
be able to run the application/use certain functions.

Local configuration
After that, you need to create file /app/config/local.neon with local settings 
for database and application. An example:

parameters:
    database:
        dsn: "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=heroesofabenez"
        user: heroesofabenez
        password: qwerty
    application:
        server: sTest
        webmasterMail: "jakub.konecny2@centrum.cz"
php:
    date.timezone: Europe/Prague
di:
    debugger: true

On live servers add the following lines at the end of the file:
application:
    errorPresenter: "Error"
    catchExceptions: true

. They enable our error handling.

Web server
Apache
If you're using Apache, you have little work to do as the repository contains
all needed .htaccess files. However with that configuration you would have to
clone the repository to /heroesofabenez. If you want to have it in different
location, edit accordingly line
RewriteBase /heroesofabenez
in /.htaccess and (optionally) set up a virtual host.
NGINX
If you have NGINX, you (currenty) have to do all server configuration by yourself.
General
It is adviced to install the game to server's root and use localhost, 
<yourcomputername>, or hoa.local as server's name. If you wish to use your
computer's name, add its name to array $dev_servers in BasePresenter::getRealId().
